Notes on .svg slides
--------------------

.svg format, produced in Inkscape with JessyInk extension (http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Tools#JessyInk)

`open-source-graphical/open_source.svg <open-source-graphical/open_source.svg>`_ - non-embedded fonts, for editing (need proper fonts installed)

`prebuilt/open_source_graphical_paths.svg.gz <prebuilt/open_source_graphical_paths.svg.gz?raw=true>`_ - fonts converted to paths (uncompress and view in browser)

* view in a modern browser with javascript enabled
  * for navigation, use left/right arrows to do the fade-in effects, or up/down arrows to skip them#
* edit using Inkscape with JessyInk extension installed
  * JessyInk extension homepage http://code.google.com/p/jessyink/
  * probably already installed with recent Inkscape versions (look for /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/jessyInk.js)
